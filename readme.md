# Face Tracking Camera

This is my attempt at creating a face tracking camera using 2 9g servos, a 3D printed support, and an Arduino Uno. The main difference in this project compared to others I've found is the use of a PID controller to (hopefully) make it more stable.

I used this model from Thingiverse for the support: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:887075
